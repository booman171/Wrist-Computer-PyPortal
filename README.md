# Summary
This is a wrist worn device I am designing as part of a larger body-worn project. This was heavily inspired by the wrist-worn computer the astronaut wears in the movie 'The Martian', as well as the Pip-boy from Fallout.

The top and bottom pieces are held together by two screw pieces. There are ducts inside the frames of the top and bottom pieces to send wires from the top to the bottom. This way I can add additional sensors and peripherals.
